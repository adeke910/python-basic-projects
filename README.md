# python-basic-projects
This project aim was to write a python code used to generate receipt.
The items are inputed along with the price.
A fixed tax price is automatically added to the total price.
The total price is printed followed by a special message.
The crea8invoice project contains fixed prices for fixed productsand price 
while the upgradedcrea8invoice is more advanced because it allows for multiple products and their prices to be added as it requests the inputs and the loop only breaks when 'p' is inputed as a product. 
A WHILE loop was used to acheive this.
